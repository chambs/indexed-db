#Indexed DB learning
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Using_IndexedDB

So far I have created a simple and still very poor API for manipulating a couple things with the IndexedDB.

Initial features include:
* Create a database
* Open an existing database
* Create tables (actually they are called object stores)
* Remove tables (same as above)
* Open transactions
* Open tables
* Simple queries returning all content from a table

Next steps are:
* Make it possible to create smarter queries
* Implement data update
* Improve the API in a way that it might be really easier to use
* Create some examples showing how to use the API
